#  Avocado Market Trend Analysis Case Study

This repository presents a comprehensive **data analytics project** exploring pricing and sales trends in the **U.S. Avocado Market** using **R and R Markdown**. The analysis leverages Kaggleâ€™s *Avocado Prices Dataset* to uncover insights that can guide **marketing strategies, pricing optimization, and supply chain planning** for grocery retailers.

##  Project Overview

The study investigates how factors such as **region, avocado type (conventional vs. organic), and time** influence both **average prices** and **sales volumes**. By combining descriptive statistics, time series visualization, and comparative analysis, the project highlights key business insights and actionable recommendations.

##  Objectives

* Identify regional differences in avocado prices and sales performance.
* Explore how seasonality impacts price fluctuations and demand.
* Compare sales patterns between organic and conventional avocados.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to improve marketing and inventory strategies.

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** tidyverse, lubridate, janitor, ggplot2, dplyr
* **Deliverables:** RMarkdown (.Rmd), HTML Report, PDF Report

##  Key Insights

* **Seasonal trends** reveal that avocado prices peak during specific months, likely due to demand surges.
* **Organic avocados** are consistently priced higher but show **lower volume** compared to conventional ones.
* **Regional variations** indicate that the West Coast markets have higher average prices, while the South shows greater volume sales.
* **Negative correlation** between price and total volume implies classic demand elasticity â€” as prices rise, sales decrease.

##  Business Impact

Retailers can use these insights to:

* Adjust pricing dynamically during seasonal demand peaks.
* Tailor promotions for regions with price-sensitive consumers.
* Plan inventory more accurately to minimize waste and maximize profit.
